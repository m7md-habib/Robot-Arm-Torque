 # Robot Arm Torque Calculation and Servo Selection
 ‚öôÔ∏è How Torque is Calculated

To calculate the torque (œÑ) at each joint of the robotic arm, we use the following physics equation:

Where:

- **œÑ (Torque)**: rotational force (in Newton-meters)
- **m**: mass being lifted (in kilograms)
- **g**: gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s¬≤)
- **r**: distance from the rotation axis to the load (in meters)

We assume each joint carries the weight of everything beyond it in the arm (including links + payload).

## üìå Task Overview

This project includes:

1. Calculating the torque required at each joint of a robotic arm.
2. Selecting appropriate servo motors based on the torque needs.
3. Evaluating whether the same motors can lift 2 kg instead of 1 kg by adding gears.
4. Discussing the challenges and providing alternative solutions.

## üß† Can These Motors Lift 2 kg With Gears?

‚úÖ **Yes**, by adding a gear reduction system (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1), the effective torque output increases, allowing the same motors to lift heavier weights. Keep in mind, speed will be reduced as a trade-off.

|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lower speed         | Gear reduction slows down movement.                                        |
| Overheating         | Motors can get hot when operating under high torque.                        |
| Mechanical complexity | Gears add weight and design complexity.                                  |
| Power consumption   | Heavier loads require more current from the power supply.                  |
| Vibrations          | Higher torque and rapid stops/starts can cause shaking.                    |
